# Assignment 10: Lists and Iteration Patterns

We're getting some practice with a few of the common "patterns" that we have
been learning. The focus is primarily on using lists and iteration to validate
input, create list maps, filter lists, and reduce lists.

## Learning Objectives

1. Use lists to help with input validation
2. Practice with basic iteration patterns including
   - map
   - filter
   - reduce

## Assignment Structure

The assignment is structured into the following exercise folders under the root
folder `assn-10-yourusername/`:

- `01-get_valid_input`
- `02-size_finder`
- `03-bleepit`

Each folder contains specific tasks that you need to complete.

## Assignment Completion Procedures

You will complete and submit this assignment in a similar way to prior
assignments. To avoid cluttering up this README with the same instructions each
time, they have been broken out into a separate file. Please reference
[PROCEDURES.md](PROCEDURES.md) to see the details if you have forgotten.

In summary:

  1. Complete the code for each exercise per the instructions
  2. Run the scripts to test and debug
  3. Execute the automated tests to ensure expected functionality

When finished, do not forget to:

1. Commit and Sync:
    - Switch to version control tab
